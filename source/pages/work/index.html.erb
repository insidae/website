        <h2>Front-end Web Developer - Dressipi</h2>
        <h3>2015 - 2017</h3>
        <p>
            I enjoyed working at Dressipi for over two and a half years. During that time Iâ€™ve 
            helped clients like John Lewis, Nike, and Topshop design and build branded web-apps. 
            I created UX-focused wireframes, professional UI mock-ups, polished working prototypes, 
            and coded the front-end. I also acted as an in-house designer creating icons, style 
            guides, and marketing material.

        <h2>Front-end Web Developer - Draw Digital Ltd.</h2>
        <h3>2014 - 2014</h3>
        <p>
            During my time as a front-end web developer at Draw I was working with several high-profile 
            clients. I was primarily tasked with the final stages of development on the new Official 
            Charts Company website. I worked to the client's strict specifications and integrated polls 
            and competition modules making sure that everything was coded to be responsive across a wide 
            range of digital devices. I also performed cross-browser testing and created a variety of 
            assets from logos to affiliate links.
        </p>
        <p>
            I worked closely with the talented design and tech 
            teams during my time at Draw and was praised by the team lead for the quality of my code 
            before finishing work on the project.

        <h2>Junior Web Developer - Edukit</h2>
        <h3>2014 - 2014</h3>
        <p>
            Edukit are an exciting education-based tech start-up based on Silicon Roundabout in 
            Central London. They aim to bridge the gap between schools and the wealth of youth-
            programmes available for the benefit of students.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was brought in as the sole front-end developer on the project and started by cleaning 
            up the working prototype for initial viewing by investors early on. After we successfully 
            secured funding, I was tasked with completely redesigning the UI for the web app based on 
            my own conducted UX research. We went through a lot of internal and external testing 
            before arriving at a final concept everyone was thrilled with.
        </p>
        <p>
            The small team were very passionate about the project and I enjoyed working with them very 
            much. We've stayed in touch since I finished work on the project and I'm sure we'll see 
            Edukit helping many schools and students in the future.
