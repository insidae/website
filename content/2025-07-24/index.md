It's been a while since I last updated the website. While writing articles here is *not* my highest priority, I *have* felt a little guilty... just not quite guilty enough to **do** anything about it. How about we try and fix that?

As it happens, I know an excellent way of encouraging regular interactions using manufactured digital guilt... one with a proven track record.

*A digital pet that feeds on articles.* Without new articles, it'll get angry, then sick, before eventually dying and making me feel **incredibly** guilty. So it's emotional blackmail to the rescue. An elegant solution, from a more civilised age.

<div class="book-info">

        <h3>So, like a Tamagotchi?</h3>
        <p>
            Kind of. While <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi">Tamagotchi</a>, released by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandai">Bandai</a> in 1996, was one of the first handheld virtual pets, they were only available in Japan to begin with.
        </p>
        <p>
            They launched worldwide the following year alongside another product designed by Bandai. This one, intended as a more <i>'masculine'</i> counterpart to Tamagotchi.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a 7-year old boy, this was obviously the one that caught my attention. That product was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digimon">Digimon</a>.
        </p>

A bit of backstory: I grew up in the 90's so my childhood was absolutely dominated by Pokemon.

But while I **did** really enjoy playing the Pokemon games and collecting the trading cards, I was one of the quiet minority who preferred Digimon. The TV show was better and I liked that it featured protagonists from **our** world travelling to another world (a trope commonly known these days as [Isekai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isekai)).

I found it more relatable. The 'digital' world was well-designed and full of interesting liminal details but the story really ramped up when the cast of characters returned with their digimon to the 'real' world.

It left such an impression on me that when I finally visited Japan 25 years later, I took some time to visit a few of the locations featured in the show (one of the more memorable scenes features the Fuji TV station building in Odaiba).

Of course, I took my original digital pet with me.

Which brings us back to the task at hand. How do I put a digital pet on this website in a way that encourages me to write articles more frequently?

### The Idea

For the idea to work as intended, the digital pet will have to be pretty faithful to my childhood experience. That means consequences for not looking after it.

<div class="book-info">
    <div class="left">
        <h3>How does a digital pet work?</h3>
        <p>
            A lot like a real pet. You have to feed it, train it, and clean up after it. If you don't, it'll show displeasure.
        </p>
    </div>
    <img class="cover" src="/Static-Digipet.gif" alt="This little guy was always hungry" />
</div>

This is the bit where I detail the logic and how I animated, designed, and coded the finished solution.

It will probably feature at least a few spritesheets and examples of code.

But there's no guarantee any of this will actually help. Right?

Nothing's ever guaranteed, no. Still, somehow...

I have a feeling it will.
