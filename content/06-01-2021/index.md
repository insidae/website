This is the first game review I've written for the site. It hadn't occurred to me to write reviews for anything other than the books I was reading, but I've always enjoyed gaming and Cyberpunk 2077 is definitely worth talking about.

There's been a lot of controversy surrounding the game's troubled launch, but there are plenty of reviews already discussing that and I'd prefer to focus on the things the game got right. 

I'm actually a big fan of the cyberpunk subgenre, but hadn't planned on buying this game at launch. There were two reasons I changed my mind.

First was the prospect of a two-week Christmas break spent stuck in my flat while the country struggled to slow the spread of COVID. The second reason was the recent purchase of a new graphics card (that will be featured in an upcoming article) that I was itching to test out on the latest demanding titles.

Cyberpunk 2077 is an open-world, action-adventure story set in Night City, a megalopolis obsessed with power, glamour and body modification. You play as V, a mercenary outlaw going after a one-of-a-kind implant that is the key to immortality. You can customize your characterâ€™s cyberware, skillset and playstyle, and explore a vast city where the choices you make shape the story and the world around you.
