I started writing a novel over two years ago. Initially I kept quiet about progress but it wasn't long before I announced my intentions <a href="/writing-a-novel">here</a>, on my website.

At that point I had about 45,000 words (roughly half the word count I was aiming for) and progress showed no signs of stopping. I felt very smug.

Then suddenly, about a year ago, I stopped writing.

There wasn't any particular reason. I didn't get hit by a bus, or decide writing wasn't for me. I just woke up one day and didn't sit down to write anything before going to bed at the end of the day.

That day turned into weeks, and those weeks turned into months.

When I did finally decide to sit back down and open the draft, I was shocked at how inconsistent my writing was. Character names and locations kept changing, important plot points contradicted each other, and some of the subplots faded away entirely, never to be mentioned again.

The worst bits though, were the large gaps in the story where I'd skipped ahead because I hadn't known what to write and told myself I'd figure it out later.

I've read it's good to get some distance from your story for just this reason; to look back at it with fresh eyes so you can see the flaws more clearly. Then it's up to you what you choose to do with this new-found perspective.

Deciding to try and salvage things, I embarked on a merciless editing spree, fixing inconsistencies and deleting large swathes that no longer made any sense. By the time I was finished, my word count had gone from roughly 46,000 words back down to 21,000. Less than half what I'd been so smug about only a few months earlier.

If this sounds painful and demoralising, it was, but I was also surprised to find the remaining text read much better than it had before. The themes I wanted to explore were much more obvious and the meandering plot was far better defined and more cohesive.

Since then, I've made the conscious decision to slow down and actually take the time to learn more about the process and what makes a satisfying story **work** in the first place. I'll outline (pun intended) the advice I've found most helpful so far.

### Proper Outlines

This was the big one for me. If you've ever looked into writing a novel, chances are you've come across the terms **'pantser'** and **'plotter'**. The basic idea is that some writers like to fly by the seat of their pants, and others prefer to plot every last detail out before getting started.

(I've also heard them referred to as 'Gardeners' and 'Architects').

I initially began writing without an outline. Starting with that terrifying blank page, and not knowing the first thing about writing, I opted to leap in head-first.

This seemed to work at first, but only got me so far and I now find it hard to believe this process works for anyone at all (but apparently it does). What **has** worked for me is outlining basic plot points and deciding on story structure ahead of time. Research of the most popular methods lead me to the tried-and-tested 3-act structure:

Starting with the **1st trigger event** at the very beginning of the story, we follow the protagonist's journey, with its varied triumphs and setbacks, until we reach the climax and **resolution**.

Along the way, we hit several common plot points that inform how things are going for our protagonist (note the **moment of despair** at the end of Act 2).

The idea isn't to generate stories that are all basically identical, but that many satisfying stories can be told utilising a pattern we're all familiar with. Well-known examples include *Star Wars*, *Harry Potter*, and *The Matrix*.

### Chiastic Structure

Chiastic structure can also help when outlining. It can be overly simplified as **symmetry** in storytelling, both in terms of recurring plot elements and common themes. There's something about symmetry that we've always found pleasing and satisfying. A quick example in storytelling might be;

*At the beginning of a story, perhaps a protagonist isn't taken seriously by their peers and longs to prove themselves. To this end, they attempt something daring but it goes horribly wrong and their situation is made even worse.*

**Symmetry demands that the problem is solved in a similar manner.**

*Things are bad, but the protagonist makes another daring attempt to right the wrong. After succeeding against all odds, they are accepted by their peers and finally acknowledged.*

Chiastic structure is arguably even more useful when used across a wider collection of stories (think of famous movie trilogies or a series of books with several installments). Let's look at *Harry Potter* as an example:
