I've always liked the idea of having a home server. Conventional wisdom says not to bother, but a lot of the reasons for hosting your own server make sense to me: sharing personal files and media, backing up important data, even rendering your own builds or hosting websites.

But you can do these things with other people's servers, usually more easily or for cheaper, so why bother hosting your own? One reason can be to remain independent of the big tech companies like Google or Amazon (privacy matters to me). Another is that by building and hosting my own server, I can learn more about them and be more self-sufficient.

        They're well-suited to a lot of the tasks I'd be using a home server for. Designed for heavy use over long periods of time, server-class components; Intel Xeon processors, abundant ECC RAM, PCIE slots, and hard drive bays.

        The fact that I've always wanted one and just happened to find this 2008 model on eBay for a good price sealed the deal.

## Hunting one down

### I started looking on eBay in January

When Apple announced the new Mac Pro in June 2019, I was reminded of how much I'd loved the design of the previous Mac Pro tower, so I started to look into them. After reading the incredible [Definitive Mac Pro Upgrade Guide](http://blog.greggant.com/posts/2018/05/07/definitive-mac-pro-upgrade-guide.html) by Greg Gant, I decided to try and find a 2008 Mac Pro, known as the 3,1 model. 

My reasoning being that the earlier 1,1 and 2,1 models were already too obsolete, and that the newer 4,1 and 5,1 models were still too expensive owing to the fact that they were much easier to upgrade and still run current operating systems (with relatively small effort).
