## Intro

A personal website makes sense, but why am I writing this journal?

There's a prevalent idea that once something's on the internet, it's there to stay. Immovable and no longer under your absolute control, it's invincible and untouchable. Extreme effort must be exerted if you want to have any hope of ever removing it, and if someone has already made a copy... you're completely out of luck.

But I have first-hand experience of the actual fragility of digital ephemera. Of course, websites like "WayBackMachine" offer a glimpse into the past, but unless the content owner takes steps to provide an archive (or the content proves popular enough to warrant duplication and proliferation) then it's all too common for information, design, code, content, to disappear forever.

For example: Over the years I've had several personal websites, but none of them are still live. I stopped designing and coding new material for each one long before I allowed the hosting to lapse. Eventually I even let the domains go, until the only evidence they ever even existed are folders of code and dusty design files on my own local archived hard drives.

I intend for this website to be the last personal website I ever create, and the first one I never finish.

My aim is to use it as a platform for growth and to keep it up-to-date with my thoughts and progress, and also to showcase any design work that I'm particularly proud of. Most importantly though, I want it to still be live and available years and years down the line. The look and feel of the site will likely change and evolve as time goes by, but I like the idea of my older journal posts still being public when the year 2019 seems ages ago.

Of course, the content of these journal entries will have to be of a certain standard. One I'll still be proud to host years from now. In that vein, I'd like to write guides for the things I've learned during my time as a Web Developer (and many more things I still have yet to learn).

Learning in public, and more importantly, documenting your learning process offers the best possible retention rates of new knowledge. We're always seeking to optimise our time, especially with regards to personal improvement and growth. Efficient learning then, seems likely to offer potential for exponential growth over time.

Through my own learning over the years, I've come to agree with an idea called the Learning Pyramid. The idea outlines retention rates that can be expected with different learning processes, with passive learning (such as attending lectures) being less memorable than say, attending a discussion group and debating an idea.

Documenting my own learning here in this journal will serve dual purposes; it'll optimise my own growth and provide the best possible rates of retention, and later on, serve as a list of credentials. Not to mention helping others who're trying to learn the same skills.

I've had personal website over the years, but none of them are still live. This time I aim to build one that will last. One that will change and evolve over the years, but will still be the same website.

I aim for this to be the last personal website I build.

Straight off the bat, influences include the personal websites of Tania Rascia, Paul Stamatiou, and Andrew Kim. These three websites are so well-designed (and contain such well-written content) that I've never had to bookmark them. I never fail to remember each one.

They each have elements I'd like to emulate.

Primarily, I'd like to use my site for myself. Using the journal entries to document my learning and, in doing so, learn faster and retain more.

If other people can benefit from those journal entries and the guides I write, that's great. But first and foremost, it'll be a springboard for my own improvement. That's the goal.
