## Intro

Why am I writing this journal?

Learning in public, and documenting your learning process, offers the best possible retention rates of new knowledge. We're always seeking to opitimise our time, especially with regards to personal improvement and growth. Efficient learning then, seems likely to offer potential for exponential growth.

Through my own learning over the years, I've come to agree with an idea called the Learning Pyramid. The idea outlines retention rates that can be expected with different learning processes.

Documenting my own learning here in this journal will serve dual purposes; It'll optimise my own growth and provide the best possible rates of retention, and later on, serve as a list of credentials. Not to mention helping others who're trying to learn the same skills.
