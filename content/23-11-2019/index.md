<!--- NOTE: I want this post to go live on my 30th birthday --->


I've had personal websites over the years, but none of them are still live. This time I aim to build one that will last. One that will change and evolve over the years, but will essentially still be the same website.

<blockquote>"I intend for this website to be the last personal website I ever create, and the first one I never finish."</blockquote>

Straight off the bat, influences include the personal websites of developers and designers such as Tania Rascia, Paul Stamatiou, and Andrew Kim. Their websites are so well-designed (and contain such well-written content) that I've never had to bookmark them. I never fail to remember each one.

They each have elements I'd like to try and emulate.

Primarily, I'd like to use my site for myself. Using the journal entries to document my learning and, in doing so, learn faster and retain more. There's a concept called the Learning Pyramid. The idea outlines retention rates that can be expected with different learning processes, with passive learning (such as attending lectures) being less memorable than say, attending a discussion group and debating an idea.

<blockquote>"If you can't explain it properly to a six-year-old, then you don't understand it well-enough yourself."</blockquote>

Documenting my own learning here in this journal will serve dual purposes; it'll optimise my own growth and provide the best possible rates of retention, and later on, serve as a list of credentials. Not to mention helping others who're trying to learn the same skills.

If other people can benefit from the journal entries and guides I write, that's great. But first and foremost, it'll be a springboard for my own improvement. That's the goal.

As a secondary goal, I'd like for it to still be live and available online for years and years to come. The look and feel of the site will likely change and evolve as time goes by, but I really enjoy the idea of my older journal posts still being public when the year 2019 seems a distant memory.

So, educational and reliable. That's the plan. If it's nice to look at... well, that's just a bonus.
