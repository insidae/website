The first PC I ever built was completed in late 2012. I'd spent months planning and researching which parts to get before making my choices and waiting for them to be delivered. Successfully assembing it and booting up for the first time was terrfiying and incredible.

While I had planned for it to last me many years, I could never have guessed I'd still be using it as my main rig almost ten years later. It's followed me through some of the most important chapters of my life thus far, like when I moved to London in 2014 (and didn't even have a desk).
